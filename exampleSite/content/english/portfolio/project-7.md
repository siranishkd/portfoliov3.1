# Financial Hot Stocks Tracker

#### Description
Back in Jan 2021,  most people were familiar with the stock market news with regards to highly shorted stocks such as GME and AMC. Alongside these stocks, TSLA and cryptocurrency such as BITCOIN and ETHEREUM saw a surge in price as well. 

So how did their rise compare to each other? 

This data visualisation I created uses their price at the start of Jan 2020 as reference. At its peak, GME was 75 times higher than its price from the 1st trading day in Jan 2020. It will be interesting to see what happens in the next few weeks. Are there any other stocks I should compare GME too?

This visualisation was created using R (ggplot2, gganimate). I was inspired by a few visualisations I have seen + the constant chatter regarding this topic. Shoutout to Reddit user Sandiependleton for guiding me on how to layer the graphs over each other and fine-tuning my code.
