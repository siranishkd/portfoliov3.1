#### Description
Back in Feb 2020, Covid-19 was an incoming threat that very few countries took seriously. I was interested in tracking the spread of it early on when close to no visualisations were available. This bar chart race portrays this data in an interesting manner. It shows signs that on hindsight should have made governments take better and faster action in battling this virus. 

You can find more updated bar chart races on my [youtube account](https://bit.ly/3zuZJez).

### Additional Information

During the first half of 2020, I worked with a brilliant web developer [Ken Chung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-chung-a71aa71a0/) to create visualisations for his website - [coronavirus.thebaselab.com](coronavirus.thebaselab.com). During its peak in Feb-Apr 2020, the website received on average 400,000 daily visitors. People around the world wanted to keep track of this new virus and how it was affecting the people around them. This inspired the idea of creating a COVID-19 dashboard which I worked on a year later in 2021. 

You can find a few of my visualisations from Ken's website archived [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20200401121011/https://coronavirus.thebaselab.com/).
