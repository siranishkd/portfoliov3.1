# Climate Change

#### Description / Problem Statement

Climate Change is a long term change in the average weather patterns that have come to define Earth's local, regional and global climates. These changes have a broad range of observed effects and impacts. 

Changes observed since the early 20th century are primarily driven by human activities, particulary fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere, raising Earth's average surface temperature. 

Natural processes also contribute to climate change, including internal variability (eg: Cyclyic ocean patterns) and external forcings (Volcanic Activity). 

#### Project Aim

1. Cover the full extent of Climate Change, the causes, impacts, solutions and recommendations. 

2. Deep Dive into the largest contributors of climate change (Food Industry) and provide feasible solutions.

3. Perform predictive analytics using Tableau for future temperature increases with and without action taken. 

#### Key Skills

- Tableau Visualisation

- Exploratory Data Analysis

- Data Wrangling and Cleaning

- Research and Teamwork 

- Tableau Analytics
